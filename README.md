# Personal Finance Manager

## Overview

The **Personal Finance Manager** is a C++ application that allows users to record, manage, and analyze their personal financial transactions. It provides functionalities to add income and expense entries, display transaction history, calculate current balance, categorize expenses, generate monthly summaries, and visualize the balance evolution through a Python graphing script.

## Features

- Add income and expenses with date, category, and description.
- View transaction history.
- Calculate and display the current balance.
- Show expenses grouped by category.
- Generate monthly financial summaries.
- Save and load transaction data from a CSV file.
- Export balance evolution and visualize it with an interactive graph using Python (Plotly).

## Project Structure

- `main.cpp` – Entry point of the program.
- `Menu.h` / `Menu.cpp` – Console menu logic for user interaction.
- `FinanceManager.h` / `FinanceManager.cpp` – Core logic for storing and processing financial data.
- `Transaction.h` – Defines the Transaction class, encapsulating all relevant data for each financial operation.
- `utils.h` – Input validation utilities.
- `show_balance.py` – Python script to plot the balance evolution.
- `makefile` – Build script for compiling, running, and cleaning the project.

## Requirements

- C++17 compiler (e.g., g++)
- Python 3.x with the following libraries:
  - `pandas`
  - `plotly`

## Build and Run

1. Compile the program using the provided Makefile:
   ```bash
   make
   ```

2. Run the application:
   ```bash
   make run
   ```

3. To clean build files:
   ```bash
   make clean
   ```

4. To visualize balance evolution, run:
   ```bash
   python show_balance.py balances.csv
   ```

## Notes

- Ensure `balances.csv` is generated by the application before running the Python script.
- This project follows a modular architecture for easy maintenance and future extensions.
